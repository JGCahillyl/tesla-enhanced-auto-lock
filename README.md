# Tesla Enhanced Auto-Lock Feature Proposal

## Overview
This repository contains a pseudocode proposal for an "Enhanced Auto-Lock" feature for Tesla vehicles. It addresses two real-world issues Tesla owners face:
1. **Safety When Occupied**: The car stays unlocked when someone’s inside (e.g., my daughter waiting in a dark parking lot to pick up a friend), posing a security risk.
2. **Unreliable Walk-Away Lock**: The current system sometimes fails to lock due to phone key detection glitches.

## Proposed Feature: Enhanced Auto-Lock
- **Core Idea**: A timer-based lock (e.g., 3 minutes) that activates when doors are closed and the car is in Park, with customizable options.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Reliable Backup**: Locks after a delay if Walk-Away Lock fails, bypassing proximity issues.
  - **Occupied Safety Mode**: Optional toggle to lock when occupied (via cabin sensors), ensuring safety in vulnerable situations—internal unlock remains available.
  - **Customization**: Set delay (1-15 mins) and toggles ("Lock When Occupied", "Force Timed Lock") via `Controls > Locks`.
  - **Integration**: Uses existing Tesla tech (cabin sensors, lock system, app notifications).

## Pseudocode
See the detailed pseudocode in [enhanced_auto_lock_pseudocode.txt](https://github.com/JGCahillyI/tesla-enhanced-auto-lock/blob/main/enhanced_auto_lock_pseudocode.txt).

## Why This Matters
- Enhances safety for occupants in risky scenarios.
- Solves owner frustrations with inconsistent locking.
- Fits Tesla’s tech-forward, user-centric design.

## Pitch to Elon
This was pitched to @elonmusk on X with this message:
> "Hey @elonmusk how about "Enhanced Auto-Lock" for TSLA? (1) Auto-lock >3 mins when occupied so my daughter’s safe in a dark lot. (2) Auto-lock >3 mins when shut & parked, solving Walk-Away fails | Set in Controls | Also, Grok3 agrees | Pseudocode: bit.ly/GitHub-tesla-l… Thoughts?"

## Next Steps
- Feedback welcome! Hoping Tesla considers this for a future update.
- Check the pseudocode for implementation details.
