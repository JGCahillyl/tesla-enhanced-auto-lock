Hey @elonmusk, can we get an "Enhanced Auto-Lock" for Tesla? Two tweaks to solve real owner headaches: (1) Enhance owner safety by providing option to lock when occupied (via cabin sensors). Eg, So my daughter’s safe when she's waiting to pick up a friend in a dark parking lot. Internal unlock still works; (2) Auto-lock after a set delay (e.g., 3 mins) when doors are closed & in Park. A reliable backup for Walk-Away Lock’s periodic glitches. --> Set delay & toggles in Controls > Locks.
